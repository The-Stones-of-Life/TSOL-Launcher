# Made By [Realz](https://www.github.com/kingrealzyt) with help from [Ryorama](https://github.com/ryorama) and [Nicklas](https://github.com/nicklascode)! 

# What is this?
This is an optional launcher you can download for the game we are working on, The Stones of Life, if you want to play older versions of the game / modded versions, this is what you would use to do it! You do not need this to play the actual game though this is Optional!
